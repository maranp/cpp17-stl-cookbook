std::istream_iterator - an input iterator
  * dereferenced to read a value pointed by
  * on incrementing, value dereferenced is invalidated

std::forward_list - forward iteratator
  * can be iterated multiple times but only in fwd direction

std::list, std::set, std::map - bidirectional iterator
  * can be incremented and decremented multiple times

std::vector, std::deque - random access iterator

std::array, std::vector - contiguous iterator

std::ostream_iterator - output iterator
  * dereference to write
  * increment only and can't repeat

iterator from non-const container instance - mutable iterator
  * it is an ouput iterator and as well one of the above other iterators

To build an iterator,
 * inherit std::iterator
 * implement *, ++, == operators
